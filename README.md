# WebAppProject
A simple web app created for a senior project

## Demo


## Requirements:
*Responsive
*Editable text
*Save Functionality
  *Database connection
  *Create a link to send edits to others
 

## Next Steps:
*Making font type and size editable to the user
*Creating a hamburger menu from the side menu 
  *Side menu currently limits responsiveness of website
  *Partial code exists, commented out
  *Will likely need JQuery to expand functionality
*Adding more <div> boxes with editable text
